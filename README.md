# Introduction 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 17.9 million people died in 2019, accounting for 32% of deaths worldwide. Most deaths (85%) from CVD were due to heart attack and stroke ("Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)", 2021). CVD is also divided into four groups:  coronary artery disease (CAD), which is also referred to as coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and aortic atherosclerosis (Lopez, Ballard & Jan, 2021). 
Atherosclerosis occurs due to narrowing of the arteries due to plaque build-up. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the large arteries and is the primary cause of heart disease and stroke (Lusis, 2000). 

Many risk factors lead to the development of the CVD: 

1. Age

2. Sex

3. Smoking

4. Genetics 

5. Alcohol consumption

6. Physical inactivity 

7. Diet 

8. Environmental Factors

When a person comes to the doctor, the first step is the risk assessment, where a GP asks about your medical and family history, checks blood pressure, and does a blood test to check the cholesterol levels. Any further tests include: ECG, exercise stress test, X-rays, echocardiogram, coronary angiography, radionuclide tests, MRI scans, CT scans. 

# Aim of the project
To visualise data and train different machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and assess their accuracy. 

# Objectives: 

1. Investigate correlation between variables

2. Divide data into training and test sets

3. Train MLAs
